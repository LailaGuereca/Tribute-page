      <h3 class="list-title">Here's a list of her 10 best songs</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Summertime (1968):</strong> From the opera "Porgy & Bess" by the famous George Gershwin, who knew how to combine it with blues and jazz.</li>
        <li><strong>Piece of My Heart (1968):</strong> Originally performed by Erma Franklin, although Janis had no trouble making it one of her signature songs.</li>
        <li><strong>Little Girl Blue (1969):</strong> Janis's version of the classic created by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart for the musical Jumbo is one of the most remembered and compared only to other versions that made greats like Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra or Diana Rosss. Her scractchy and heartfelt voice provokes bittersweet sensations between melancholy and passion.</li>
        <li><strong>Cry Baby (1970):</strong> It was originally composed for Garnet Mimms, however, Janis Joplin made it immortal, becoming one of the most representative of the legendary rocker.</li>
        <li><strong>Mercedes Benz (1971):</strong> It was his testament, his swan song. It is the last song that the legendary artist recorded in life. Due to his untimely death, there was no time to put it to music, leaving an a cappella version for Pearl's release. A bitter goodbye.</li>
        <li><strong>Down on Me (1968):</strong> This song was close to folk and became one of the most rock songs in their repertoire during live performances. The definitive version was the one recorded on March 2, 1968 at The Grande Ballroom in Detroit that appeared on the 'In concert' album released in 1972.</li>
        <li><strong>Ball and Chain (1968):</strong> It was established as one of the most mythical songs and the one that used to close the repertoire of his concerts, either with the Big Brother or solo. He appeared on Cheap Thrills and had one of his most unforgettable performances. Her performance at the Monterrey Festival was what made her become a star.</li>
        <li><strong>Get It While You Can (1971):</strong> It is one of his best performances and yet another song by one of his favorite composers, Jerry Ragovoy, for whom he also did the spectacular Cry baby on the same album.</li>
        <li><strong>Me and Bobby McGee (1970):</strong> This song delivers the definitive version of the classic composed by Kris Kristofferson for Roger Miller. Together with her acoustic guitar, Janis maximizes her voice and shows the world that she was a star to sing rock, blues or country, styles that when the American singer sang them, they only sounded like herself.</li>
        <li><strong>Turtle Blues (1968):</strong> It is one of the few songs in Joplin's repertoire composed by herself. With a piano and an acoustic guitar as the only accompaniment, the singer likes it and shows her musical talents when it comes to singing blues. In addition, it appears included in 'Cheap thrills'.</li>
