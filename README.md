# Tribute-page
 Description:  A tribute page of Janis Joplin

## The content
 Based on the example given by [freecodecamp.org](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/), this project will be a tribute page that contain:  
 + A hero image of Janis Joplin  
 + an alternative text of that image  
 + a tittle
 + a time line of her most famous albums or songs
 + a quote
 + and finally, an external link

## Design
 Based on the next image, here comes to me some ideas:
 ![Janis Joplin](/images/Janis-Joplin.jpg)  
 + A black and white minimal page look
 + maybe like a newspaper

## Learning path
 ### Glosary
  + `<main></main>`: this element represents the main content of the `<body>` of a document or application. This refers to content that is directly related to the central theme.
