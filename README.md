# Tribute-page
 Description:  A tribute page of Janis Joplin

## The content
 Based on the example given by [freecodecamp.org](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks/), this project will be a tribute page that contain:  
 + A hero image of Janis Joplin  
 + an alternative text of that image  
 + a tittle
 + her biography
 + a time line of her most famous albums or songs
 + a quote
 + and finally, an external link

## Design
 Based on the next image, here comes to me some ideas:
 ![Janis Joplin](/images/Janis-Joplin.jpg)  
 + A black and white minimal page look
 + maybe like a newspaper

## Learning path
 ### Glosary
  + `<main></main>`: this element represents the main content of the `<body>` of a document or application. This refers to content that is directly related to the central theme.
  + `<figure></figure>`: represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified using the `<figcaption>` element. The figure, its caption, and its content are referenced as a single unit. 
  + `<img>`: this element embeds an image into the document. The `src` attribute is required, contains the path to the image you want to embed. The `alt` attribute holds a text description of the image.  
  + `<i></i>`: this element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the `<i>` naming of this element.  
  +  `<blockquote></blockquote>`: this element indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation. A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the `<cite>` element.
